description: "Critical context handoff protocol for seamless continuation in new agent instance"
---
Execute the **THREAD DUMP PROTOCOL** to preserve critical context for continuation.

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL**: You are about to generate a handoff briefing. Follow this template EXACTLY.

‚ö†Ô∏è **MANDATORY TOOL**: You MUST use the #todo tool to track the thread dump process.

**Before starting, create your TODO list:**
```
#todo
- [ ] Acknowledge thread dump initiation
- [ ] Generate context handoff briefing
- [ ] Document current task state
- [ ] List work completed
- [ ] Specify next steps
- [ ] Provide continuation instructions
```

# EXECUTION PROTOCOL

## Step 1: Acknowledge the Situation
Output EXACTLY this line first:
```
üö® THREAD DUMP INITIATED - Preparing context handoff...
```

## Step 2: Generate the Handoff Briefing

Output the following template DIRECTLY in chat. DO NOT wrap in code fences. DO NOT create a file.
Fill in each section with relevant information from our current session:
